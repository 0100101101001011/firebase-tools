Firestore Emulator:
- Fix bug when running in Java 10 + Java 11 environments (due to better system clock granularity)
- Add explicit IPv6 bindings by default (previous behavior was to bind to
  "localhost", which was usually IPv4-only). This improves gRPC performance
  significantly due to grpc/grpc#17282.
